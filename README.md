## Task 1: RISC-V ISA and GNU Toolchain

### Overview
This task introduces the fundamental concepts of RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) and sets up the development environment using the VSDSquadron board.

### Implementation Steps

#### 1. GNU Toolchain Setup and C Program Analysis

*Configuration of RISC-V GNU Toolchain on VSDSquadron board. The image shows the successful installation and verification of the RISC-V GCC compiler toolchain, essential for cross-compilation of RISC-V programs.*

#### 2. Cross-Compilation Process
